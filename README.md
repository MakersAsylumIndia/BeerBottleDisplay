# BeerBottleDisplay
the **Drill Press Cafe** beer bottle display code

- Initial code was for a scrolling display with a 16 pixel Wide x 7 pixel Tall matrix (16x7).
- Existing matrix is 16x6 so the scrolling matrix code no longer works.
- Use the "Matrix_Designer" Spreadsheet to design your characters - RED cells are the LEDs which will be turned on.
- The Matrix is zig-zag, start point is top right corner, so LEDs are numbered accordingly.
- Create an "array" consisting of the LEDs that need to light up.
- Also, count the "number of LED's" that need to light up for each word - this is required to be added in the code manually.
